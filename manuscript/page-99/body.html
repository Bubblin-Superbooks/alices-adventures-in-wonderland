First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withinâ€”a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. </p><p>'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'</p><p>'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. </p></div> </div>
