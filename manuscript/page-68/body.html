Why, it fills the whole window!'</p><p>'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p><p>'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'</p><p>There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. </p><p> This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'. </p></div> </div>
